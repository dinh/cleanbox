# Cleanbox Installation

1. Go to your Google Drive and create a new Google Apps Script.
   ![GDrive > New > More > Google Apps Script](installation/gdrive.png)
2. A new tab will be open. When asked for, click *Blank Project*.
   ![Create script for Blank Project](intallation/blank.png)
3. Copy the content of [script.js](script.js) and paste into the typing area.
You should replace any default code that was created with the new project --
not quite blank after all, huh? ;-)
4. Rename the *unnamed project* to *Cleanbox* (if you wish).
5. On the top bar menu, click *Resources* and then *Current project's triggers*.
